# QUAD-MAPS
## Overview
This is a 2D mapping system that takes in LiDAR readings to create a probabilistic occupancy grid
mapping system that can be saved in the RAM of the on-board computer (while the scanning is going on)
in a compressed form.
## Project Outcomes/Deliverables:
• A physical set-up that can be used to scan any area and generate a map for the same.
• A lossless compression-based mapping system that can scan and store details of a large
amounts of area in a single go with reasonable accuracy.
• Documentation of all the steps above, so as to if anyone wishes to learn from the
experience or continue, they find an easier start point.
